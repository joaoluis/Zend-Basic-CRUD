This project was made as part of a job application. Here is the original request:

 
----------
Using the Zend Framewok, implement a simple web-app that deals with Programming Languages, stored in a sqlite database. A programming language has 2 fields: Name and Description. The name must be unique. Both fields are required.

It should implement the basic CRUD (create, read, update and delete) actions, plus a single-input form for full-text search, which should work over both fields. The search results are delivered through ajax.

Authentication is not required. CSS styling is not required.
----------
